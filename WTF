$a expand split no quotes // done
expand or not expand inside heredoc! //done




cat | cat | ls // ny close FDS // ny probably same



// recheck the heredoc for crashes bitch

// history is deleted for some reason sometimes

if before env in quoted arg, who cares
cuz it's joined by default
however if in ARG you must follow until there is no
before env!

expansion is stolen "()" by operators (EXCEPT EXECUTABLES, WHICH ARE NOT OPERATORS 
BUT SPECIAL ARGUMENTS!)
arg spots, however they are freed if they are not
bothered!

executables with space in their name shall be executed however executables
which were expanded but had space in the expansion shall be treated
of course as a single n


expand inside expand
do not split by space XD aka mind quotes!!

 // minishell_no_alzheimer is for getting the value before it has splitted
 // there has to be a special function to handle splitting with
 // quote

 // checker for quotes won't segfault or undef because quotes are checked
 // on input not after parse!!!!

// the split by quote happens for each pair after the reexpansion
// so that means it gets the values flat then it splits them, it
// doesn't split the variables them gets them!
// quotes that were environment variables are fake quotes??


// heredoc stuck with first input

///// test later for null env vars because they can happen in your code!!

I've gotten rid of empty envs made them
into empty strings in the expand

[IMPORTANT !] set exit status for minishell signals!
